# Podcast Note

This plugin allows you to easily take notes on podcast in Obsidian


## How to use it
You can add a new podcast note by opening the comman pallete (cmd + p) and selecting "Add Podcast Note".
A prompt will open where you can enter the URL for the podcast you want to take notes on. 


Of course you can also specify a keyboard shortcut to trigger the prompt.
